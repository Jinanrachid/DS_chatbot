Continuous monitoring and security assessments using AWS Security Hub were also useful to address possible vulnerabilities in a proactive manner.Cost OptimizationForgoing the costs of maintaining servers on-premises and extensive licensing costs, Smartrise were able to optimize their costs and focus their resource investment on development and delivery acceleration.Agility and Management OffloadingWith AWS services, Smartrise has achieved impressive agility and slashed management overhead. The dynamic scalability of AWS enables swift adaptation to evolving demands, with the managed services significantly reducing routine management tasks.ResultDrivenSeamless MigrationThe migration was executed with minimal downtime to the companiesâ€™ production workloads, addressing both security vulnerabilities and the high costs and restricted scalability associated with on-premise management.Future ScalabilityThe re-architecting project and adoption of AWS cloud resources has positioned Smartrise for future scalability, adaptability, and innovation.
