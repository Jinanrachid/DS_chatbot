The GenAI Hype: Where is the ROI? Cezar Ashkar June 30, 2025 Blog Table of Contents Why Generative AI Fails to Deliver ROI — And How to Fix It Generative AI is everywhere, from customer support to code generation. But ask most companies what it’s doing for their bottom line, and the room gets quiet, fast. GenAI has taken the world by a storm, from writing code and marketing content to transforming customer support and knowledge management. Companies across various industries are racing to integrate GenAI in their workflows, since it seems everybody is doing it. But underneath the surface, a different reality is emerging. While adoption is widespread, measurable return on investment—aka ROI—is not. Companies are launching their own pilots, integrating tools, and building custom AI solutions. But many struggle to turn that into real business value. Everyone’s excited. Budget is enough. But the results? Disappointing. So why is GenAI failing to deliver on its promise for so many? In this blog, we explore the distance between implementation and impact, uncover the common traps organizations fall into, and outline a better path to unlocking the real value of Generative AI. The Hype vs. Reality Gap Enthusiasm alone doesn’t guarantee outcomes. In the rush to create, many leaders found themselves asking the question: where is the return? As many of them skipped foundational steps to ensure timely delivery and become “early adopters,” projects were launched without any clear objective, using useless data or lacking any actual alignment with their business priorities. As a result, many of them failed to scale. A recent McKinsey report found that while over 70% of businesses are experimenting with AI, only a fraction have achieved significant ROI. That gap between using GenAI and benefiting from it is growing wider—and more costly. Common Pitfalls in GenAI Adoption During the rush to deploy, most businesses struggle to convert their projects to measurable ROI. The reasons are often strategic and operational rather than technical. Below are the most common pitfalls that were observed. 1. No Clear Business Objective. Many adopted GenAI out of the feeling that they have to, but without any actual purpose like reducing cost, improving efficiency, or increasing revenue. When the “why” is unclear, so is the outcome. 2. No Measurable Success Metric. It is nearly impossible to improve what you don’t measure. Without any clear KPIs such as time saved, productivity gains, or impact on customer satisfaction, it is hard to track ROI or even prove its value to stakeholders. 3. Tech-First, People-Last. AI is a tool, not a standalone solution. It doesn’t create value on its own. It needs people to use it effectively. The problem is, many organizations rush to roll out GenAI tools but forget to bring their teams along for the ride. Without proper training, support, or a clear plan for how these tools fit into daily work, adoption stays low. Employees either don’t trust the tools, don’t see the value, or simply don’t know how to use them. The result? Great tech, sitting idle. 4. Poor Data Quality. Garbage data fed into an AI model results in sparkly but still garbage outcomes. GenAI is only as good as the data it has access to. What ROI in GenAI Should Look Like When done right, GenAI creates clear and measurable value. Here are a few signs that it’s delivering real ROI. 1. Efficiency Gains. Teams spend less time on manual tasks like summarizing text, drafting content, or searching for information. Example: A legal team cuts contract review time by 60%. 2. Better Customer Experience. AI responds faster and more accurately to customer needs. Example: A support team handles 30% more tickets with AI-generated responses. 3. Higher Productivity. Marketing, sales, and HR teams use AI to create campaigns, write emails, and prepare reports. Example: A marketing team generates copy in minutes instead of hours. 4. Revenue Impact. Sales teams reach more qualified leads with personalized messaging. Example: A SaaS company doubles its email conversion rates with AI-generated outreach. 5. Faster Innovation. Teams use AI to test ideas quickly and move from concept to launch faster. Example: A product team speeds up design iterations using AI-generated mockups. These results are possible when GenAI is aligned with clear goals and real business needs. A Simple Framework for Actually Getting ROI from GenAI If you want real value from GenAI, you need more than a shiny chatbot or a dozen pilots gathering dust. Here’s a simple framework to keep things grounded. V – Vision. Before you even assess or select a model, get clear on what you’re trying to achieve. Is your goal to reduce customer response times? Automate repetitive internal tasks? Improve content production? “Because it’s cool” is not a strategy. GenAI should support a real business objective, not just check an innovation box. Align it with your company’s goals so it’s solving problems that matter. Ask yourself: What business outcome are we targeting? How will success be defined? A – Assets. GenAI runs on more than just clever prompts—it needs the right foundation. If your data is scattered, outdated, or locked in siloed systems, your results will be just as disjointed. But data isn’t the only asset to consider. You also need the right infrastructure, tools, talent, and governance in place to support your AI goals. Make sure you have: 1. Clean, structured, and relevant data. 2. A scalable and secure cloud infrastructure. 3. Pre-trained models and toolkits. GenAI isn’t plug-and-play. These assets are what allow it to function, scale, and deliver value consistently—not just in a pilot. L – Levers. What’s the business lever GenAI can actually pull? Too many teams implement GenAI without knowing what needle they want to move. Focus on areas where impact is both meaningful and measurable. Think reduced time-to-resolution, increased conversion rates, or cost savings per task. Examples of value levers: 1. Productivity per employee. 2. Customer satisfaction scores. 3. Sales conversion or marketing output. 4. Hours saved on manual processes. No vague outcomes. No “let’s just see what happens.” Choose a lever and stick to it. U – User Enablement. The best AI tools in the world won’t matter if no one uses them. You need to actively onboard users, provide training, and build trust. People need to understand what the tool does, how to use it, and more importantly, how it helps them work better—not just harder. Watch for: 1. Lack of clarity: “What am I supposed to do with this?” 2. Shadow adoption: Employees secretly using third-party tools they’re more comfortable with. 3. Resistance: Skepticism that AI solutions might take over their jobs. Empower users early. Make it part of their workflow, not extra homework. E – Evaluation. If you’re not measuring, you’re guessing. Track performance from day one, run small experiments, collect feedback, and adjust. AI initiatives need a feedback loop—not just to show ROI, but to keep improving. What to measure: 1. Quantitative: usage data, efficiency gains, error rates, revenue impact. 2. Qualitative: user satisfaction, friction points, trust in the tool. 3. Time-bound checkpoints: Are we better off now than 30 days ago? Hope is not a plan. Evaluation turns intuition into insight. How We Help We’ve seen the excitement. We’ve also seen the reality check.

Final Thoughts GenAI isn’t magic. It’s not going to fix broken processes, bad data, or unclear goals. But when used with intention, it’s one of the most powerful tools businesses have ever had. The difference between companies getting ROI and those burning budget comes down to this: strategy, not just technology. So if your GenAI project feels more like a science experiment than a business initiative, you’re not alone. But it doesn’t have to stay that way. Want to stop experimenting and start delivering?
