Traditional methods often involve over-provisioning, which increases costs and reduces energy efficiency. Description AI-powered network operations solutions dynamically monitor network conditions and optimize the allocation of bandwidth and routing in real time. By analyzing traffic patterns and predicting congestion points, AI can automatically adjust resource distribution and reroute data to prevent bottlenecks. Additionally, AI can power energy-efficient features such as placing Radio Access Networks (RANs) in low-power mode during periods of low traffic, improving both service quality and energy efficiency. Added Value Improved Network Performance: AI optimizes routing and resource allocation in real time to avoid bottlenecks and ensure consistent service quality. Efficient Bandwidth Utilization: Dynamically redistributes network load during peak periods to prevent congestion and optimize network coverage. Cost Savings: Reduces unnecessary over-provisioning and lowers energy consumption by placing RANs in low-power mode during off-peak hours. Faster Response to Traffic Spikes: AI enhances customer experience by automatically adjusting to sudden traffic surges without service interruptions. Telecommunications Network Optimization Bandwidth Management Resource Allocation Business Problem Telecom networks are frequently targeted by fraud schemes such as SIM-swapping, call-spoofing, and unauthorized data access. Traditional fraud detection methods rely on static rules and manual oversight, making it difficult to detect sophisticated and rapidly evolving threats.
