You don’t want a model rewriting task definitions or provisioning new infrastructure without validation steps. Every action taken by the agent must be logged, explainable, and reversible. Explainability becomes critical when AI decisions directly impact uptime or cost. Teams should also consider using fine-tuned models for log parsing and action selection, particularly for sensitive environments. What’s changing now is the maturity of the ecosystem. Serverless infrastructure removes operational overhead. Foundation models bring reasoning.
