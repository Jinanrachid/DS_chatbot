But the simplest way to describe it is if you focus on one of them you don’t want to go super wide. You want to actually touch on all of them. So imagine this as an approach, your MVP needs to address a certain slice of everything, that’s why its really important to think whats the minimum feature that will allow you to build that exact thing. Product Evolution MVP is obviously not a customer-facing term, while your first customers are gonna be your early adopters and your product will still need work. If we are trying to solve the hypothesis of transportation for people we might start with a skateboard then move to a scooter then get more complicated from there. That’s why an MVP should be the really bare-bones, it shouldn’t be the wheel or tire and you don’t release it until you have a car. That’s an overbuild. Don’t get distracted with features outside your scope and don’t get distracted by things that don’t prove your hypothesis at its basic core level. It’s better to have something that flows and can be progressively useful as you go on. Each one of these phases could be considered a product. If you were to build the wheels in the first phase and the engine in the second, you wouldn’t have something useful whereas here I can get A to B in the first phase “skateboard to bike to car, I can still achieve the same goal you are trying to do, your vision from one place to another but better and better over time and it’s still a minimum viable product at each stage.
