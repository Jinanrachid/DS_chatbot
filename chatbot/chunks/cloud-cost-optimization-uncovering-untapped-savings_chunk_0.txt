Cloud Cost Optimization: Uncovering Untapped Savings Amine Malaeb May 12, 2025 Blog Table of Contents Cloud computing has become a backbone for many businesses, but along with its flexibility often comes surprisingly high bills. The truth is, a significant chunk of cloud spend is usually wasted or misallocated – money that companies could save with a bit of attention.
