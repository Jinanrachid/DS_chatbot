Not long ago, people thought AI was just a hype and even long before that people thought AI was just in movies and sci-fi novels. Nowadays, it is not coming for the future – it’s already embedded in today’s smartest businesses, and intertwining deep into their DNAs. From billion-dollar algorithms optimising every click and every recommendation, to behind the scenes AI innovations that are reshaping functions and transforming businesses inside out. Integrating AI into business operations has become a strategic imperative in 2025; companies leverage AI aiming to enhance efficiency, drive innovation, and maintain a competitive edge. Companies that are not aligning with today’s AI standards are considered outdated, and even losing their competitive edge; all companies, no matter the scale are being hit hard if they are not properly including AI in their ecosystems – a prime example is Apple where it has been heavily criticised and facing tremendous backlashes due to the quality of Apple Intelligence and Siri’s AI capabilities compared to other platforms including but not limited to Google Gemini. Wide Spread Adoption As we have covered, AI is taking businesses by storm – it was estimated that as of 2025, 78% of companies are reporting the use of AI in at least one business function, which is a 23% increase from 2023 alone. Not to mention that 71% of organizations have integrated generative AI tools into their operations which was increase from last year’s 65%. More and more investments and deals are being done by the day to increase the capabilities of AI – Global venture capital investment in AI startups alone exceeded 131.5 billion dollars in 2024 marking a 52% increase form 2023. Major companies themselves, are making a stand and investing absurd amounts in building AI infrastructures that accommodate the increase in demands. To highlight more on the infrastructure sides, Microsoft allegedly is committed with an 80 billion dollar to enhance AI infrastructure in fiscal 2025, and Meta platforms increased the expenditures to between 64 and 72 billion dollars to expand their AI capabilities. Innovations With all these investments, time, and labour, companies were able to develop innovative AI integration strategies to align with “Today’s AI Standards”. AI factories were built to accommodate large platforms – Uber and Netflix invested heavily in AI factories to have centralised systems to continuously process data top optimise their services from personalised recommendations dynamic pricing. The marketing and Advertising sectors are being engulfed with AI as well. Companies like Nike, BMW, Coca-cola, and many more are utilising AI to create personalised and creative marketing advertisements to fit their products and business needs. All of this while keeping in mind that myriad of AI tools are still in under development, yet still producing targeted and engaging marketing campaigns.
