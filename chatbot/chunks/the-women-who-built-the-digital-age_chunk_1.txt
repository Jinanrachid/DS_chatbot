Her insights were so profound that they weren’t fully appreciated until nearly a century later when modern computers began to realize her prophetic vision. The Code Breakers of World War II: Women Behind the Machines During World War II, while history books often highlight military strategists, a group of extraordinary women were solving complex mathematical problems that would change warfare and computing forever. The ENIAC programmers – Jean Jennings Bartik, Kay McNulty, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas, and Ruth Lichterman – were the first to program the world’s first general-purpose electronic computer. Working with the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), these women didn’t just operate a machine; they fundamentally understood and programmed it at a time when computer programming didn’t even exist as a defined profession. They wrote complex ballistics trajectory programs, debugging the machine with nothing more than logical thinking and extraordinary mathematical skills. Grace Hopper: The Admiral Who Spoke the Language of Computers If computing had a rebel, it would be Grace Hopper. A rear admiral in the U.S. Navy and a pioneering computer scientist, Hopper developed the first compiler – a revolutionary tool that translated human-readable code into machine language. Her work laid the groundwork for COBOL, a programming language that became the backbone of business computing for decades. Hopper was famous for her unconventional approach and memorable quote: “It’s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.” She quite literally invented the concept of machine-independent programming languages, making computing accessible to people beyond mathematical elites. Bridging the Past and Present: Women in Tech Today These women didn’t just work in technology – they transformed it.
