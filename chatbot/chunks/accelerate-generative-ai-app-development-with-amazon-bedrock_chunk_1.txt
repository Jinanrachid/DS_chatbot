AI serves as an encompassing term for a diverse array of advanced computer systems. However, for a more precise perspective, let’s narrow our focus to “machine learning.” Much of what we encounter in today’s AI landscape can be categorized as machine learning—imparting computer systems with the ability to learn from examples. When we speak of machines learning from examples, we often refer to them as “neural networks.” These neural networks acquire knowledge through exposure to numerous examples. For instance, teaching a neural network to recognize the Eiffel Tower entails feeding it a vast and varied collection of images capturing the landmark from various angles and perspectives. Through this extensive training and appropriate labeling, the model gains the ability to distinguish the Eiffel Tower in a photograph from other elements, enabling swift and accurate recognition. Language Models In the context of Generative AI, the process shares some similarities, primarily revolving around language models, a unique category of neural networks. Language models excel in anticipating the next word within a sequence of text. To enhance their predictive capabilities, these models undergo extensive training with substantial volumes of textual data as well. One method for refining a language model involves exposing it to a more extensive corpus of text, mirroring how humans expand their knowledge through study. Consider, for example, the phrase “I am flying on an…”; a well-trained language model can accurately predict “I am flying on an airplane.” As training deepens, the model’s proficiency grows, enabling it to generate nuanced responses and offer valuable insights into the probable continuation of the sentence. Evidently, this forms the revolutionary foundation for what we now refer to as “Generative AI.” Building upon the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can have up to hundreds of billions of parameters, Generative AI excels at creating entirely new content based on the knowledge it has accumulated. Currently, Generative AI extends its reach beyond text, delving into various media formats, including images, audio, and even video. This raises the question: how can we tap directly into this technology without the need for an extensive data corpus or even stored data to train and deploy? Amazon Bedrock Amazon Bedrock opens the doors to a world of generative AI possibilities, offering a diverse array of features and foundational models that empower developers and businesses to harness the full potential of this transformative technology. Choice of Leading Foundation Models: With Amazon Bedrock, you gain access to a versatile array of high-performing Foundation Models (FMs) sourced from top AI companies, including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon. This diversity allows you to explore a wide spectrum of models within a single API, providing the flexibility to adapt and experiment without extensive code changes. Effortless Model Customization: Tailor these models to your unique needs with ease, all without writing a single line of code. Amazon Bedrock’s intuitive visual interface empowers you to customize FMs using your own data. Simply select the training and validation datasets stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal model performance. Fully Managed Agents: Break new ground with fully managed agents, capable of dynamically invoking APIs to execute complex business tasks. From travel booking and insurance claim processing to crafting ad campaigns and inventory management, these agents extend the reasoning capabilities of FMs, offering a solution for a myriad of applications. Native RAG Support: Amazon Bedrock is fortified with Knowledge Bases, enabling secure connections between FMs and your data sources for retrieval augmentation. This feature enhances the already potent capabilities of FMs, making them more knowledgeable about your specific domain and organization. Data Security and Compliance: Amazon Bedrock prioritizes data security and privacy, having achieved HIPAA eligibility and GDPR compliance. Your content remains confidential, not used to enhance base models or shared with third-party providers. Data encryption, both in transit and at rest, ensures the utmost security, and AWS PrivateLink seamlessly establishes private connectivity between FMs and your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), safeguarding your traffic from exposure to the Internet. Why Amazon Bedrock? Amazon Bedrock is a comprehensive, fully managed service that revolutionizes generative AI development. Offering a selection of high-performing FMs from leading AI companies, it simplifies the process of building generative AI applications while preserving privacy and security. Experiment with top FMs, customize them with your data, create managed agents for complex tasks, and seamlessly integrate generative AI capabilities into your applications, all without the need to manage infrastructure. With Amazon Bedrock, you can confidently explore the limitless possibilities of generative AI using the AWS services you already know and trust. Below are the models offered as of November 2023: Amazon Titan: Ideal for text generation, classification, question answering, and information extraction, with an added text embeddings model for personalization and search. Jurassic: Specializing in instruction-following models for various language tasks, including question answering, summarization, and text generation. Claude: A model for thoughtful dialogue, content creation, complex reasoning, creativity, and coding, grounded in Constitutional AI and harmlessness training. Command: Tailored for text generation, optimized for business use cases, based on prompts. Llama 2: Offers fine-tuned models, particularly well-suited for dialogue-centric use cases. Stable Diffusion: An image generation model that produces unique, realistic, and high-quality visuals, including art, logos, and designs. And this is merely the starting point, considering that AWS Bedrock was unveiled in September 2023. Amazon Bedrock in Action Now, without further ado, let’s demonstrate the rapid application of Amazon Bedrock models to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is an architectural approach that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT by integrating an information retrieval system. This system empowers you to exert control over the data accessible to the LLM during response generation, ultimately improving the quality of generative AI. In essence, RAG enables LLMs to tap into additional data resources without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining. Creating your own LLM can incur expenses ranging from $450,000 to millions of dollars, with a training duration that could extend to months 2 .
