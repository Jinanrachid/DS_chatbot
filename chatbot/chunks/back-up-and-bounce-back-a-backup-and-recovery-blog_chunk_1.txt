Your servers, your strategy. Strategies are divided into four kinds: Backup & Restore: Ideal for users prioritizing availability and cost optimization, even at the expense of longer recovery times in terms of RPO and RTO. Pilot light: Tailored for users seeking a balance between readiness and cost-effectiveness, the Pilot Light strategy is optimal. This approach maintains a minimal operational core, similar to a pilot light, allowing for rapid scale-up during recovery while minimizing costs associated with regular operations Warm standby: This strategy keeps a partially active system ready. This approach strikes a balance, offering faster recovery times than a Pilot Light while maintaining cost efficiency compared to a fully operational system. Multisite or Active/Active: This option utilizes a fully operational copy of your active system, all configurations replicated, with zero downtime and near zero data loss, and made for mission critical services, aka, not for the faint of heart, as it is the most expensive of all options. Backups are often categorized into three parts: Full backups : During this procedure, all information housed on a production server is moved to a backup server for safekeeping. The time needed for full backups is flexible, spanning from several hours to potentially days, contingent on the amount of data being conserved. These backups protect every bit of data originating from a single server, database, or virtual machine (VM).
