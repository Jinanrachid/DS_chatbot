2. Cross-references with past incident tickets for this substation (via ServiceNow). 3. Flags a similar case last month that was solved by isolating a capacitor fault. 4. Outputs steps with part numbers and a request-to-replace form prefilled. Outcome: What used to be a 45-minute call to dispatch is now resolved on-site, with full traceability. When Amazon Q Business Makes Sense (And When It Doesn’t) Perfect Fit For: 1. Internal productivity use cases, where you need AI that understands your organizational structure. 2. English-language environments (other languages to be supported in the future). 3. Teams that want subscription-based pricing rather than usage-based billing. 4. Organizations with complex permission structures that need to be respected. Look Elsewhere If: 1. You are building customer-facing AI applications (try Amazon Bedrock instead). 2. You need multi-language support immediately. 3. You want to customize the underlying AI models extensively. 4. You are building the next ChatGPT competitor. The Bedrock vs. Q Business Decision Tree (Simplified) 1. Choose Amazon Bedrock if you are a developer building AI applications for others to use. 2. Choose Q Business if you are a business leader who wants your team to work smarter without becoming AI engineers. 3. Choose both if you realize different tools solve different problems. Making Q Business Work: The Success Formula The most successful Amazon Q Business implementations follow a simple pattern: 1. Start with a clear use case that makes people’s daily work obviously better.
