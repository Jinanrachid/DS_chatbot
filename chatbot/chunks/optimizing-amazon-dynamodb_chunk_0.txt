Optimizing Amazon DynamoDB: Avoid These Common Mistakes Cezar Ashkar March 27, 2025 Blog Table of Contents Amazon DynamoDB is a highly scalable, low-latency NoSQL database designed for modern cloud applications. However, if not properly managed, it can lead to performance issues, unnecessary costs, and security vulnerabilities. This guide highlights key pitfalls and best practices to help optimize your DynamoDB implementation. Designing Inefficient Partition Keys DynamoDB partitions data across multiple storage nodes based on the partition key. A poorly chosen key can lead to uneven data distribution and performance bottlenecks. Common mistakes include using sequential values (timestamps, auto-incremented IDs) that overload a single partition and selecting a low-cardinality key with few unique values. To optimize: – Choose a high-cardinality partition key to evenly distribute data. – Use composite keys (partition key + sort key) for efficient data retrieval. – Implement write sharding by adding a random suffix to partition keys. Overusing Scans Instead of Queries DynamoDB queries are optimized for retrieving data using indexed attributes, while Scan operations read the entire table, making them inefficient and costly. Common mistakes include using Scan instead of Query and failing to design a schema that supports efficient queries. To optimize: – Always use Query over Scan when possible. – Design tables with Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) to support multiple query patterns. – If scans are necessary, apply filters to minimize data retrieval. Mismanaging Read and Write Capacity DynamoDB offers Provisioned and On-Demand capacity modes. Misconfiguring them can lead to throttling or unnecessary costs. Common mistakes include overprovisioning capacity, underprovisioning leading to degraded performance, and choosing the wrong capacity mode for the workload. To optimize: – Use On-Demand mode for unpredictable workloads. – Use Provisioned mode with auto-scaling for steady traffic. – Enable DynamoDB adaptive capacity to handle traffic spikes automatically. Treating DynamoDB Like a SQL Database Applying SQL-style normalization to DynamoDB can create inefficiencies, requiring multiple lookups instead of optimized single-table queries. Common mistakes include normalizing data excessively and expecting to perform complex joins and aggregations like in SQL databases. To optimize: – Denormalize data when needed to reduce query overhead. – Use a single-table design with well-planned keys.
