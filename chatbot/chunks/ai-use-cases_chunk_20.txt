Telcos need a way to simulate real-world scenarios to optimize network performance, reduce capital expenditures, and adapt dynamically to evolving customer demands. Description Digital twin technology, powered by AI, allows telcos to create virtual replicas of their network infrastructure to simulate real-world conditions and stress-test different configurations. These simulations provide insights into optimal base station placements, coverage gaps, and performance under various scenarios. By predicting network performance and capacity needs, AI-driven network design solutions enable telcos to optimize resource allocation, minimize costly deployment errors, and scale their infrastructure more effectively. Added Value Enhanced Planning Precision: AI-powered digital twins simulate real-world network conditions and stress-test different configurations, ensuring optimal placements of network components. Faster Time-to-Deploy: Simulations accelerate decision-making for network expansions and upgrades, reducing the time needed for design iterations. Resource Optimization: AI models predict coverage, capacity, and performance under various conditions, minimizing overprovisioning and ensuring efficient use of spectrum and hardware. Cost Efficiency: By testing different configurations virtually, telcos can avoid costly trial-and-error deployments and prevent unnecessary capital expenditure.
