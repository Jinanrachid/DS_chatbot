With this, each save to your code, your stack is deployed. In the case where auto-save is on, your infrastructure is up-to-date almost all the time as CDK is ‘always watching’. Wrapping up. In conclusion, cloud infrastructure deployment offers a spectrum of methods catering to various levels of expertise and convenience. Whether navigating the AWS console, mastering the CLI, or leveraging the power of Infrastructure as Code, each approach presents its unique set of advantages and challenges. Prominent IaC tools and services such as AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) each bring distinct benefits to the table. CloudFormation offers robust features that facilitate infrastructure management across multiple AWS accounts and regions. Terraform’s cloud-agnostic nature and powerful HCL language make it an invaluable tool for multi-cloud environments. Additionally, CDK empowers developers to write infrastructure code in familiar programming languages, bridging the gap between development and operations. As a developer you truly are free to use whatever you want, but try using CDK, as i assure you, if you haven’t tried it yet, you’ll be surprised with how familiar it feels.
