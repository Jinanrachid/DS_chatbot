Or did you know that 700 million malware attempts were recorded in 2021 alone? Or even that according to Cybersecurity ventures, cyberattacks are deemed to cost companies a north of $10 trillion dollars by 2025, which was an increase from the $3 trillion in 2015. These are not trends or events – this is a genuine crisis. Let me hit you all with a sobering reality – you might think major corporations are too fortified or immune to fall into the trap of cyber breaches, but the history tells a different story; in 2014, Heartbleed exposed a vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library which lead to massive leaks of personal information, and in 2017 WannaCry ransomware caused over $4 billion in damages affecting hospitals, businesses, and governments worldwide. All of these are just the tip of the iceberg, these are not isolated incidents – these are wake-up calls to all the companies present now and in the future.
