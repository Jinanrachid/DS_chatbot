The solution revolved around key AWS services that symbolize the power of modern cloud-native infrastructure including AI/ML. We were not just integrating AWS services but reshaping the way Virtual Minds interacts with cloud-based resources. To start with, we adapted AWS Lambda functions for serverless computing, an aspect of AWS that allows running code without the need for managing servers. Serverless architecture offers greater scalability and flexibility, making it an excellent fit for a dynamic, growing company like Virtual Minds. Next, we focused on managing RESTful APIs through AWS API Gateway, a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. We specifically tailored API management to ensure compatibility with Virtual Mindsâ€™ systems and the third-party tools in use.
