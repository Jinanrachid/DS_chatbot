They’re going to just start using it immediately. How many people actually care what Lyft looks like. Few people only care because when you need a ride you need a ride. Why do you care if there’s a button for me to request a ride? A way to pay the driver. Great, I’m all set. So it’s good if you are a perfectionist that there is someone on the team to push you to ship before you are ready. Remember it should be very minimal and it doesn’t matter how great the UI or UX looks. It just needs to be functional because you are trying to prove a single hypothesis with the minimum number of features. I’ve met a lot of startup founders who are perfectionists (I’m a perfectionist too) but you shouldn’t wait until you product is perfect but until it’s functional and useful at least at a basic minimal state and ship it out and get people using it and see if they actually like it. Because if they need it and want it they will not really care how it looks like or how beautiful it is.
