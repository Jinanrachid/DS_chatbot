Bedu: Streamlined Operations Digico Solutions July 1, 2024 Case Study About Bedu Bedu is an innovative booking platform tailored for travelers seeking unforgettable experiences in the MENA region with destinations ranging across the UAE, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. Their user-friendly website serves as a comprehensive guide, showcasing entertainment and culinary hot-spots across these three countries. They enable users to plan and personalize their trips, providing a journey through the regionâ€™s cultural and culinary richness. With Bedu, users can effortlessly schedule reservations at their preferred establishments, ensuring a hassle-free and enjoyable travel experience. The Challenge Slow Delivery and Stagnation Initially facing slow content delivery and disarrayed software life-cycle management across various development environments, Bedu sought a solution to elevate their online presence. The abundance of static content and high-quality images on their website led to latency issues, impacting user experience, particularly for those accessing the site from distant locations. Another hurdle was their lack of an isolated development environment on AWS, which caused delays in implementing crucial changes on the production front. Additionally, we tackled the challenge of re-organizing the application logic around Amazon Cognito for authentication.
