Once committed, the changes will be built and deployed again automatically by AWS Amplify. Our Example We can see that we were able to build our website using AWS Amplify in under 4 minutes. This highlights the speed at which we can take our code from built to ready to use. In the Build tab of our AWS Amplify deployment, we were able to view the build logs which referred to our AWS CodeCommit repository: In the Deploy Tab, we can also keep track of the corresponding logs in case of any errors: Once deployed, the end result shows our website up and running, where it can be accessed from a browser using the URL provided by AWS Amplify: Conclusion The journey from setting up a AWS CodeCommit repository to hosting it on Amplify and implementing CI/CD practices has transformed our development process from static to dynamic, automating deployment of changes.Thus, by leveraging such AWS services, we can build more agile and scalable application delivery pipelines. As the era of CI/CD continues to revolutionize software development, we stand confidently with these practical tools at our fingertips.
