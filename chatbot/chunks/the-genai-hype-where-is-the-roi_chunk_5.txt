V – Vision. Before you even assess or select a model, get clear on what you’re trying to achieve. Is your goal to reduce customer response times? Automate repetitive internal tasks? Improve content production? “Because it’s cool” is not a strategy. GenAI should support a real business objective, not just check an innovation box. Align it with your company’s goals so it’s solving problems that matter. Ask yourself: What business outcome are we targeting? How will success be defined? A – Assets. GenAI runs on more than just clever prompts—it needs the right foundation. If your data is scattered, outdated, or locked in siloed systems, your results will be just as disjointed. But data isn’t the only asset to consider. You also need the right infrastructure, tools, talent, and governance in place to support your AI goals. Make sure you have: 1. Clean, structured, and relevant data. 2. A scalable and secure cloud infrastructure. 3. Pre-trained models and toolkits. GenAI isn’t plug-and-play. These assets are what allow it to function, scale, and deliver value consistently—not just in a pilot. L – Levers. What’s the business lever GenAI can actually pull? Too many teams implement GenAI without knowing what needle they want to move. Focus on areas where impact is both meaningful and measurable. Think reduced time-to-resolution, increased conversion rates, or cost savings per task. Examples of value levers: 1. Productivity per employee.
