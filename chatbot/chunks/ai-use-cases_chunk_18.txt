This leads to financial losses, reputational damage, and compliance risks. Telcos need real-time, AI-powered security solutions to identify and mitigate threats proactively. Description AI-based fraud detection systems continuously monitor call patterns, network transactions, and user behaviors to detect anomalies that indicate fraudulent activities or unauthorized access. These systems can identify suspicious activities in real-time, such as SIM-swapping, call-spoofing, and unauthorized logins, and can trigger automated security responses. Additionally, AI-powered security systems adapt over time by learning from new attack patterns, making them increasingly effective at mitigating emerging threats. Added Value Real-Time Fraud Detection: AI monitors call patterns and network activity continuously to detect anomalies and prevent fraud. Enhanced Security Compliance: Such measures and features ensure adherence to regulatory standards by safeguarding customer data and preventing unauthorized access. Reduced Financial Losses: Early detection of fraudulent activities minimizes financial impact and reputational damage. Continuous Improvement: AI systems learn from new attack patterns and adapt their defenses to remain effective against emerging threats.
