They overcame significant societal barriers, working in fields where women were rarely welcomed, let alone celebrated. Their contributions extend far beyond technical achievements; they challenged fundamental assumptions about women’s capabilities in science and engineering. As we celebrate technological innovation today, we stand on the shoulders of these giants. They didn’t just write code or design machines – they imagined entire worlds of possibility that we now take for granted. Women’s Role in Modern-Day Technology Women continue to make remarkable strides in technology, leading groundbreaking research and championing diversity in tech startups. Leaders like Fei-Fei Li, who has been pivotal in advancing AI research, Ginni Rometty, former CEO of IBM, who revolutionized the cloud and AI space, and Radia Perlman, a pioneering network engineer, are empowering the next generation of technologists. However, where do women in the Arab region stand in this global technological renaissance? Women in Tech in the Arab Region Women in the Arab region are increasingly taking leadership roles in areas like cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital transformation. Prominent figures such as Dr. Aisha Bin Bishr, Deemah AlYahya, and Nora Al Matrooshi are at the forefront of these advancements. Dr. Aisha Bin Bishr , former Director General of the Smart Dubai Office, played a pivotal role in Dubai’s transformation into a global smart city, incorporating cutting-edge technologies and AI to reshape urban living. Deemah AlYahya , Chief Innovation Officer at the Misk Foundation and Secretary-General of the Digital Cooperation Organization, has been instrumental in driving Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation and fostering international collaboration in the tech sector. Nora Al Matrooshi , the first female Emirati astronaut, is breaking barriers in aerospace and STEM fields, inspiring countless women across the Arab world to pursue careers in technology and science. A Legacy of Innovation As we reflect on these achievements, it’s crucial to recognize that diversity in technology isn’t just about fairness – it’s about innovation.
