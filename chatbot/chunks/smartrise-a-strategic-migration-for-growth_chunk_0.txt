Smartrise: A Strategic Migration for Growth Case Study Founded in 2004, Smartrise Engineering was brought to life by leaders of the elevator industry who wanted to change the way business was done. The Challenge Strains of Operational Overhead Smartrise faced a dual challenge that prompted the decision to migrate its servers from on-premises data centers to the cloud. Firstly, the organization struggled with rising operational costs and the complexities of managing on-premises infrastructure. The resource-intensive nature of traditional data centers led Smartrise to seek a more cost-effective and streamlined solution. Secondly, recognizing the critical need to strengthen the security of their workloads, Smartrise took the initiative to undergo a strategic shift to the cloud. The inherent security features and advanced management capabilities of cloud services provided a compelling solution to effectively address the rapidly growing threat landscape. The Solution Security and Savings In response to the escalating costs and security concerns, Smartrise embraced a solution that involved a re-architecture and migration to the AWS Cloud. The process included re-designing their existing cloud workloads, using security best practices.
