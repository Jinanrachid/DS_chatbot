And the best part? EFS is fully managed. That means no more headaches with provisioning, patching, or maintenance. EFS handles it all behind the scenes, freeing you to focus on what truly matters â€“ your business. EFS Key Features Effortless Management Amazon EFS shines in its fully managed nature, supporting Network File System (NFS v4.0 and v4.1) and delivering shared file system storage for Linux workloads. Eliminating the need for managing file servers, hardware updates, or backups, Amazon EFS streamlines file system creation and configuration, allowing a focus on applications rather than infrastructure. With elasticity taking center stage, Amazon EFS enables automatic scaling of file system storage and throughput capacity. This eliminates the need for manual provisioning, ensuring seamless scaling to petabytes of storage, hundreds of thousands of IOPS, and tens of gigabytes per second of throughput, aligning with evolving workloads. Resilience and Availability Tailoring to different durability and availability needs, Amazon EFS offers Regional file systems, optimizing durability with data stored across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Meanwhile, EFS One Zone file systems provide a cost-effective solution with slightly less durability. Boasting 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability over a year, Amazon EFS ensures data availability with AZ-specific EFS mount targets. Versatile Storage Classes and Security Measures Amazon EFS simplifies storage management by introducing three distinct storage classes, each tailored to specific access patterns and cost considerations.
