Since 2021, the center has reduced bed waiting times from 32 to 6 hours and emergency care wait times by 14%. Over 90% of patients now receive pharmacy and laboratory services within 15 minutes. By predicting healthcare demand and optimizing patient flow, KFSHRC enhances efficiency and patient outcomes, setting a regional standard for AI-driven operational excellence in healthcare. Building the Future: IoT-Driven Infrastructure: Real-time data collection and analytics are transforming industries like logistics, smart cities, and health systems. IoT applications empower businesses, particularly SMBs, to optimize inventory, streamline operations, and enhance supply chain management, boosting competitiveness and agility. In Saudi Arabia, iot squared, a collaboration between the Public Investment Fund and stc Group, leads this IoT revolution. By integrating IoT technology across urban infrastructure, smart cities, and industrial systems, iot squared is driving improvements in energy management, transportation, and healthcare. These innovations are expected to push the Saudi IoT market to SR10.8 billion ($2.88 billion) by 2025, with healthcare and transport sectors driving growth. This integration of IoT technologies is projected to boost Saudi Arabia’s productivity and contribute 0.2% to GDP, reflecting the country’s commitment to leveraging IoT for operational efficiency​ Financial Evolution: AI and Cloud Optimizing Your Bottom Line: AI and cloud solutions are driving significant changes in the financial sector by improving decision-making, reducing operational costs, and enhancing efficiency. For example, Al Rajhi Bank in Saudi Arabia leverages AI chatbots to provide 24/7 customer support, reducing response times and minimizing the need for human intervention. Globally, financial institutions are increasingly adopting AI, with 37% deploying AI technologies in the past year, and 83% of decision-makers keen on using generative AI for tasks like risk management and compliance automation. In Saudi Arabia, STC Pay uses AI-driven fraud detection systems to prevent fraudulent transactions while ensuring a smooth customer experience. Smart Mobility: AI and Logistics Shaping Safer, Cleaner Cities In Saudi Arabia, AI-driven traffic management systems are enhancing urban mobility by addressing congestion and improving road safety. By utilizing AI and big data analytics, cities like Riyadh can dynamically adjust traffic signal timings, reroute vehicles, and provide real-time traffic updates to ease congestion. These AI solutions can significantly reduce travel times by optimizing traffic flow and predicting patterns before issues escalate​. Moreover, these systems help lower road accidents by enabling better traffic coordination, ultimately making daily commutes safer and more efficient​ Governance: Addressing Concerns With Proactive Solutions Data sovereignty remains a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation strategy, driven by a strong commitment to safeguarding national security and privacy. Recognizing these priorities, global cloud providers are tailoring their offerings to comply with local regulations, such as those mandated by the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA). For instance, AWS plans to launch an infrastructure region in Saudi Arabia by 2026, representing a $5.3 billion (19.88 billion SAR) investment. This new region will provide businesses, from startups to healthcare organizations, the ability to keep sensitive data in-country while leveraging cutting-edge cloud services. Microsoft Azure, announced at LEAP 2023, is similarly addressing growing demands for data residency and security with plans for a local data center region, designed to offer enterprise-grade reliability and high-speed performance. Meanwhile, Google Cloud’s partnership with Saudi Arabia highlights its dedication to localized solutions. Through the creation of an AI hub projected to add $71 billion to the economy, Google is advancing AI innovation while emphasizing compliance with Saudi regulations. This hub is not only fostering technological growth but also enabling sectors like healthcare and finance to adopt AI tailored to regional needs, particularly in the Arabic language. Such tailored solutions empower Saudi organizations to maintain control over their data while benefiting from global scalability and technological advancements.
