Fast forward to today, and the classroom looks quite different. The global pandemic was a game-changer, pushing teachers and students to embrace e-learning solutions almost overnight. Suddenly, the classroom wasn’t just a physical space anymore – it became a digital platform where lessons could be accessed from anywhere, whether you were sitting in your bedroom or halfway across the world (lucky you!). This digital shift wasn’t just a short-term fix. With the ease and reach of online learning, students and teachers started to see the benefits of these platforms. It’s convenient, flexible, and it works! Even with in-person classes making a comeback, there’s a lasting change in the way we now approach learning.
