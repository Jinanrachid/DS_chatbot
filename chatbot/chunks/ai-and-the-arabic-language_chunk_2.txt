In Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the part-of-speech tag set encompasses over 300,000 tags, a stark contrast to the approximately 50 tags used for English. Furthermore, MSA words exhibit an average of 12 morphological analyses, compared to just 1.25 for English words. This quantitative difference underscores the sheer scale of morphological variations that AI models must learn to navigate when processing Arabic. Tasks such as morphological analysis, which involves determining all possible morphological analyses for a word, and morphological tagging, which identifies the correct analysis within a given context, become significantly more complex due to this richness. The non-concatenative nature of Arabic morphology, where vowels are interwoven among root consonants, further complicates the application of standard NLP techniques developed for languages with more straightforward word formation. The sheer volume of potential word forms necessitates specialized NLP tools and methodologies tailored specifically for Arabic, moving beyond those typically employed for morphologically simpler languages like English. Another significant hurdle arises from the common practice of omitting diacritics (short vowel markings) in standard Arabic writing. This absence of consistent diacritics introduces a substantial layer of ambiguity, as a single undotted word can represent multiple distinct words with different meanings and grammatical functions. For instance, the undotted word “كتب” can be interpreted in several ways, such as “he wrote” (كَتَبَ), “it was written” (كُتِبَ), or “books” (كُتُب). This inherent ambiguity means that AI models must develop sophisticated contextual understanding capabilities to accurately disambiguate meaning, a challenge less pronounced in languages with more explicit orthographic conventions. Additionally, Arabic includes a significant number of irregular plural forms, often referred to as “broken plurals,” which do not adhere to predictable patterns. For example, the singular “قَلَم” (pen) becomes the plural “أَقْلَام” (pens), while “طِفْل” (child) becomes “أَطْفَال” (children).
