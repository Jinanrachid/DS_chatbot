Entertainment Virtual Reality Content Generation Interactive Media Digital Environments Predictive Maintenance for Self-Healing Networks Network Operations Optimization & Traffic Flow Management Fraud Detection & Security Enhancement IT & Support Function Automation AI-Driven Network Desgin & Digital Twin Simulations Business Problem Current maintenance strategies are either time-based or reactive, which can lead to over-maintenance or unexpected service interruptions when infrastructure components fail. This approach results in increased operational costs, service outages, and reduced customer satisfaction. Telcos need predictive, data-driven approaches to extend asset life and reduce downtime. Description Predictive maintenance leverages AI to monitor network components in real-time, detect early signs of wear or failure, and recommend preventive actions before issues escalate. This approach enables telcos to transition from reactive maintenance to predictive, data-driven maintenance schedules. It also enables self-healing networks that can automatically detect, diagnose, and resolve minor issues without human intervention, reducing service outages and improving network resilience. Added Value Reduced Downtime: AI-powered predictive models detect early signs of hardware or software failures, enabling preventive maintenance. Increased Asset Life: Ensures network components are maintained only when needed, maximizing their useful life and avoiding premature replacements. Operational Efficiency: Self-healing networks use AI to autonomously resolve issues, reducing the need for manual interventions. Lower Maintenance Costs: Such an AI-powered system can optimize resource allocation and reduce the frequency of costly on-site service visits. Telecommunications Predictive Maintenance Network Monitoring Self-Healing Networks Business Problem With the growing adoption of 5G and data-heavy services, telcos must efficiently balance network loads across multiple regions and endpoints. Unmanaged traffic spikes can cause bottlenecks, resulting in degraded user experience and customer dissatisfaction.
