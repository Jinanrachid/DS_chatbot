Arabic possesses a remarkably rich morphological system, where words are constructed through the combination of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes, leading to a vast array of potential forms from a single root. For instance, the root “ع-ل-م”, meaning “knowledge” or “learning,” can produce words like “عِلْم” (knowledge), “عَالِم” (scientist or scholar), “تَعْلِيم” (education), and “مَعْلُومَة” (information). This characteristic presents a considerable challenge for NLP tasks.
