 AWS Community Day Beirut 2023
 About
 The
 Event:
 The
 AWS
 Community
 Day
 is
 a
 complimentary
 and
 inclusive
 event
 that
 convenes
 AWS
 enthusiasts,
 professionals,
 and
 businesses
 to
 engage
 in
 knowledge
 sharing,
 acquire
 insights
 on
 the
 latest
 AWS
 technologies,
 and
 foster
 connections
 with
 industry
 peers.
 The
 event
 uniquely
 emphasizes
 startups,
 thereby
 establishing
 a
 novel
 paradigm
 for
 such
 gatherings
 within
 the
 region.
 During
 the
 AWS
 Community
 Day,
 we
 have
 scheduled
 over
 6
 engaging
 speakers,
 a
 discussion
 panel,
 and
 3
 workshops
 that
 will
 run
 sequentially
 but
 in
 parallel
 with
 the
 main
 event.
 If
 you’re
 interested
 in
 participating
 in
 the
 workshops
 and
 learning
 from
 them,
 don’t
 forget
 to
 bring
 your
 laptop
 along.
