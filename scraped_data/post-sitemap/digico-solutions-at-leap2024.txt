 LEAP 2024
 Recap
 As we wrap up on #leap2024, the biggest tech conference in the world, we are proud to have been a part of this tremendous event. With 215,000 attendees within only four days, the Digico Solutions team has had the chance to meet government officials, founders and executives, tech enthusiasts, and more.
 We left with amazing connections, huge smiles, and eyes wide open at the human potential for innovation with the opportunities tech enthusiasts can achieve.
 It was a significant event for Digico Solutions, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) announcing a whopping $5.3 billion investment in Saudi Arabia, marking the establishment of the AWS KSA region. This announcement is not just a testament to the potential of the region but also a milestone in our journey towards digital transformation.
 The AWS KSA region will not only boost our capabilities but also revolutionize the technological landscape of Saudi Arabia, bringing the country closer to its desired vision of a digital-first nation. Our team at Digico Solutions is thrilled to have been a part of this groundbreaking moment and is excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.
 This week has demonstrated the significant opportunities and potential rewards of participating in events. Investing in new geographical areas can lead to substantial growth opportunities.
