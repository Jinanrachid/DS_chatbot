Once set up, you’ll discover how the AWS CLI simplifies cloud resource management with straightforward commands. From optimizing data storage to scaling applications, the AWS CLI empowers you to make the most of AWS capabilities without delving into technical complexities.
 Whether you’re a business professional seeking streamlined cloud operations or an individual curious about AWS possibilities, this guide is designed for you. Join us as we unleash the potential of AWS CLI and elevate your cloud experience.

 With the right access, you can list groups and users
 aws iam list-groups
 and
 aws iam list-users

 aws iam list-roles
 command. This will return an array of roles, with each role name, ID, and associated policy document.
 There are many other services to discover and commands to take advantage of depending on your cloud architecture and business needs.
