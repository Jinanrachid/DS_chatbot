 Bedu: Streamlined Operations
 Digico Solutions
 ☁️
 July 1, 2024

 Case Study
 About
 Bedu
 Bedu
 is
 an
 innovative
 booking
 platform
 tailored
 for
 travelers
 seeking
 unforgettable
 experiences
 in
 the
 MENA
 region
 with
 destinations
 ranging
 across
 the
 UAE,
 Lebanon,
 and
 Saudi
 Arabia.
 Their
 user-friendly
 website
 serves
 as
 a
 comprehensive
 guide,
 showcasing
 entertainment
 and
 culinary
 hot-spots
 across
 these
 three
 countries.
 They
 enable
 users
 to
 plan
 and
 personalize
 their
 trips,
 providing
 a
 journey
 through
 the
 region’s
 cultural
 and
 culinary
 richness.
 With
 Bedu,
 users
 can
 effortlessly
 schedule
 reservations
 at
 their
 preferred
 establishments,
 ensuring
 a
 hassle-free
 and
 enjoyable
 travel
 experience.
 The
 Challenge
 Slow
 Delivery
 and
 Stagnation
 Initially
 facing
 slow
 content
 delivery
 and
 disarrayed
 software
 life-cycle
 management
 across
 various
 development
 environments,
 Bedu
 sought
 a
 solution
 to
 elevate
 their
 online
 presence.
 The
 abundance
 of
 static
 content
 and
 high-quality
 images
 on
 their
 website
 led
 to
 latency
 issues,
 impacting
 user
 experience,
 particularly
 for
 those
 accessing
 the
 site
 from
 distant
 locations.
 Another
 hurdle
 was
 their
 lack
 of
 an
 isolated
 development
 environment
 on
 AWS,
 which
 caused
 delays
 in
 implementing
 crucial
 changes
 on
 the
 production
 front.
 Additionally,
 we
 tackled
 the
 challenge
 of
 re-organizing
 the
 application
 logic
 around
 Amazon
 Cognito
 for
 authentication.
 Using
 federated
 alongside
 native
 users
 in
 Cognito,
 had
 caused
 some
 discrepancies
 and
 unexpected
 behavior
 within
 the
 application.
 The
 Solution
 Achieving
 Agility
 To
 overcome
 their
 challenges
 of
 latent
 content
 delivery,
 we
 implemented
 CloudFront
 for
 accelerated
 delivery
 using
 the
 AWS
 global
 edge
 locations,
 taking
 advantage
 of
 various
 caching
 policies
 to
 optimize
 the
 caching
 of
 different
 resources,
 including
 the
 static
 images.
 In
 order
 to
 provide
 a
 more
 accurate
 representation
 of
 changes
 and
 their
 effects
 on
 the
 stable
 production
 environment,
 we
 used
 AWS
 CodePipeline
 to
 replicate
 the
 production
 pipeline
 and
 set
 up
 a
 separate
 development
 environment
 on
 AWS
 to
 streamline
 the
 development
 process.
 Additionally,
 to
 incorporate
 security
 features
 into
 the
 pipeline,
 we
 utilized
 ECR’s
 image
 scanning
 feature
 to
 proactively
 detect
 and
 resolve
 security
 vulnerabilities
 in
 the
 application,
 before
 pushing
 changes
 to
 production.
 Regarding
 authentication,
 our
 objective
 was
 to
 optimize
 Amazon
 Cognito
 to
 establish
 a
 robust
 system
 that
 efficiently
 linked
 the
 identities
 of
 federated
 and
 native
 users,
 avoiding
 data
 duplication
 and
 ensuring
 consistency.
 This
 initiative
 not
 only
 enhanced
 security
 but
 also
 improved
 the
 overall
 reliability
 of
 user
 data.
 In
 addition
 to
 this,
 we
 conducted
 a
 comprehensive
 Well-Architected
 review
 of
 Bedu’s
 production
 workloads
 and
 addressed
 their
 high-risk
 issues,
 transforming
 their
 workload
 according
 to
 industry
 best
 practices.
 The Benefits
 Rapid Delivery
 The use of Amazon CloudFront and customizing the policies for the caching of different resources helped optimize the caching strategy in a manner tailored to Bedu’s website and resources. The deployment of the CloudFront distribution took advantage of all the global AWS locations, ensuring consistent user experiences regardless of their location.
 Peak Performance
 Following the recommendations of the Well-Architected review, we implemented detailed monitoring using CloudWatch and X-ray to identify and address performance issues in the deployed resources and application.
 Optimized Deployment
 Stepping in to manage the deployment of application and infrastructure changes and creating pipelines for each environment facilitated the deployment of changes to the production environment and ensured the stability of the website in production.
 Clear Identities
 The redundancy provided by the multi-Availability Zone setup with backup and disaster recovery on Amazon RDS MySQL ensured high availability and data protection.
 Result
 Driven
 Enhancing Website Reliability
 The use of CloudFront and CodePipeline to expedite content delivery and optimize deployments of application changes helped make Bedu’s website more reliable, consistent, and responsive.
 Improving System Performance
 The Well-Architected review helped identify performance bottlenecks with other areas of improvement, allowing us to implement the recommended actions and ultimately enhancing their system making it more resilient, performant, and scalable.
